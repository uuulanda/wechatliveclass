<h2>CARTO</h2>
<h3>What is CARTO?</h3>
<p>Carto helps you visualize and easily work with GIS data. <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects?q=cartodb">Find projects using CARTO.</a></p>

<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>When you sign up, you get an upgraded account with 250MB of space. With an upgraded account, your data is also private.</p>

<h3>How do I get access?</h3>
<p>First, ask your Brigade captain if your Brigade already has a CARTO account. If you can add your project within the existing account, that will help us share CARTO with more brigades.</p>

<p>If your Brigade needs a new CARTO account, discuss with your Brigade leader what email address you would like to put on the account.</p>

<p>To request a new CARTO account, email <a href="mailto:inkinds@codeforamerica.org">inkinds@codeforamerica.org</a> including the following information. Please cc your Brigade's captain.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which CfA Brigade you belong to</li>
  <li>A description of the projects youâ€™re working on (including URLs if they're live) and how CARTO will help.</li>
  <li>The email address you would like to use for a new CARTO account. (<b>Do not create your own CARTO account.</b>)</li>
</ul>
